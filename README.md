<h1>ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Detection using VGG19</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project uses a pre-trained deep learning model (VGG19) to accurately detect and classify 15 different types of plant diseases from the PlantVillage Dataset.
By leveraging transfer learning and fine-tuning, the model achieves high accuracy in identifying infected leaves, helping farmers and researchers with early disease diagnosis.
